Since in the last project, some students had a headache with the configuration process of easyx, so this time we used a project that does not require the configuration of external libraries. This project is called For Word. Its function is to prepare for the English 46 test by memorizing words. Level, the specific function can be discovered soon, and will not be elaborated here.
Instructions for use: Clone this project, and then unzip it. You can run this project directly in the compiler without making changes. Of course, if you have enough time, you can choose to modify the project to make it more in line with your wishes.
